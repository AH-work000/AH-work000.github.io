              in the sound when clicking your mouse across the screen!

              A wallpaper that mimics the look and the behaviour of a meteor. It involves a white meteor curl flying down through the dark 
              black sky. It eventually crashes; spawning another at any position and repeat each time! There are GUI options in the form of a knob
              to control the shape, size and the rate of descent of the meteor.

                This simple web application allows you to randomly generate a variety of forest models: trees, dead trees, stumps, rockes and logs at different 
                distinctive positions across a snowy plane. All of those models makes up a snowy forest. You have the options to configure the amount of forest models
                that is going to make up your snowy forest. There's also a refresh button to restart the forest generation if the resulting forest does not go to you
                liking. More features are coming soon to this application!

                An interactive fire particle system made using Processing Programming Language. The fire particles is animated along a
                curl path; making it a curl shape of fire particles. The positioning of the fire particle curl is binded to the 
                movement of the mouse pointer in the screen. There are some surprising changes to the fire particles if you move, drag or double-click the mouse. 
                You can also use some keyboard keys to change the colour of the fire particles.
